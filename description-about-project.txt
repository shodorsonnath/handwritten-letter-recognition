This Python code leverages the power of machine learning to recognize handwritten characters. It begins by importing essential libraries like Pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, and TensorFlow for building and training neural networks. The dataset, containing images of handwritten characters, is loaded and split into features (images) and labels (corresponding characters). These images are then preprocessed, reshaped, and normalized to facilitate effective training. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is constructed, consisting of convolutional layers for feature extraction, max pooling for down-sampling, and dense layers for classification. The model is compiled with an optimizer and a loss function, setting it up for training. The training process is visualized, showing the progress of accuracy and loss on both training and validation sets. After training, the model is saved for future use. Users can input their own images for character recognition. The code also includes functions for preprocessing and predicting characters from user-provided images. This comprehensive code provides a robust framework for training, evaluating, and using a CNN for handwritten character recognition.
